    <h1>This is ShushEngine</h1>
    <p>Check out the ShushEngine <a href="https://github.com/ZJAllen/ShushEngine" target="blank">GitHub repo</a>!</p>

    <p>This project is based on Roboteurs' SlushEngine project.  You can check them
    out at their <a href="https://roboteurs.com/" target="blank">website</a>
    or their <a href="https://github.com/Roboteurs/slushengine" target="blank">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this project is to create a stepper motor driver
    that can be easily driven by a few lines of code (currently Python). This project
    differs from SlushEngine in that it utilizes <a href="https://www.trinamic.com/products/integrated-circuits/details/tmc5160/" target="blank">Trinamic TMC5160</a>
    stepper drivers rather than L6480. These drivers are known to be silent due to
    their 256-microstepping and StealthChop&trade, hence the manipulation of the name to "ShushEngine."</p>
